Virtual design and specificity testing of RPL13A (Ribosomal protein L13a)

# Target GeneRPL13A (Ribosomal Protein L13a) is a commonly used housekeeping gene involved in ribosomal structure and protein synthesis. Due to its stable expression across different tissues and conditions, it is widely used as an internal control in gene expression studies.# Objectives  •	Retrieve the human RPL13A gene sequence from NCBI databases	•	Design gene-specific PCR primers using NCBI Primer-BLAST	•	Evaluate primer quality based on Tm, GC content, and secondary structures	•	Perform in-silico specificity analysis against the human genome# Step 1: Retrieval of Target Sequence	•	The RPL13A gene sequence was obtained from the NCBI Gene database.	•	The reference mRNA sequence (RefSeq) was selected and downloaded in FASTA format.	•	This sequence was used as the template for primer design.# Step 2: Primer Design Using Primer-BLASTPrimers were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST with the following parameters:	•	PCR product size: 70–200 bp (optimized for qPCR)	•	Melting temperature (Tm):	•	Minimum: 57 °C	•	Optimum: 60 °C	•	Maximum: 63 °C	•	Template type: cDNA (mRNA)	•	Primer design constraint: Primers were designed to span exon–exon junctions to prevent amplification of contaminating genomic DNA.# Step 3: In-Silico Specificity Testing	•	Primer specificity was checked against the Homo sapiens reference genome using Primer-BLAST.	•	The analysis ensured that primers amplify only the intended RPL13A target and do not bind to pseudogenes or other genomic regions.# Step 4: Primer Evaluation CriteriaThe selected primer pair was evaluated based on:	•	On-target specificity: 100% match with RPL13A transcript	•	Off-target analysis: No significant unintended amplification detected	•	GC content: Maintained between 40–60%	•	GC clamp: Presence of 1–2 G/C bases at the 3′ end	•	Secondary structures: Minimal self-complementarity and low primer-dimer risk# Deliverables	•	Forward primer sequence (5′ → 3′)	•	Reverse primer sequence (5′ → 3′)	•	Melting temperature (Tm) and GC content	•	Expected amplicon size	•	Specificity statement:The designed primer pair is specific to the human RPL13A gene and does not show significant off-target amplification in the human genome.
